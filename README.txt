============

This is my exercise reading the book 
"Desenvolvimento Guiado por Testes"
(Test Driven Development guided by Examples,
from the original one) of Kent Beck.

Code is not exactly equal from the book.

Each folder reflects the final chapter's code.
So, it's possible start exercise from any chapter,
overreding 'src' folder's content by
'chapterXX' folder's content.


I have used:
jdk 1.7.0_02
Eclipse 3.7.0 (Indigo)
jUnit 4
